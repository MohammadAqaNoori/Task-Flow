# TaskFlow - Task Management Web App

## Overview
TaskFlow is a cutting-edge, one-page web application meticulously crafted as part of an internship project to empower users in organizing their tasks with unparalleled efficiency. This app stands out with its sleek, dark-themed interface, featuring a sophisticated color palette of deep blacks (`#0d1117`) and glassy containers (`#161b22`), complemented by vibrant gradient accents (`#00f5d4`, `#9d4edd`, `#ff4d6d`). Developed from scratch using Visual Studio Code, TaskFlow incorporates smooth CSS animations and a fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Whether you're a busy professional managing personal to-dos, a freelancer juggling multiple projects, or a team leader coordinating group tasks, TaskFlow simplifies your workflow with an intuitive, user-friendly experience. This project was initiated to meet the specific requirements of Internship Task 3, which demanded a comprehensive task management solution with a modern aesthetic and functional depth, and it has evolved into a robust tool reflecting months of dedication and iterative improvements.

## Tech Stack
TaskFlow leverages a robust and modern technology stack to deliver its functionality:
- **Frontend**: Built with React and JSX, providing a component-based architecture for reusable and maintainable code. The app utilizes React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects.
- **Styling**: Styled with Tailwind CSS v3.4.17, offering a utility-first approach for rapid development and a consistent design system. Custom colors and animations are defined in `tailwind.config.js` and `index.css`.
- **Animations**: Custom CSS animations, including `fadeInUp` for section reveals and `gradientFlow` for dynamic text effects, enhance the user experience with smooth transitions.
- **Dependencies**: Includes PostCSS and Autoprefixer for processing Tailwind styles, ensuring broad browser compatibility, along with the Google Fonts API for Poppins and Inter fonts.
- **Development Tools**: Developed using Visual Studio Code for coding, Node.js and npm for package management, and Git for version control, with a focus on a streamlined workflow.
- **Build Process**: Utilizes `create-react-app` for project scaffolding and `npm run build` to generate a production-ready `build` folder for deployment.
